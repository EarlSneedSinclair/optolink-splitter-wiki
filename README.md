## :package: System Architecture
### How it Works
- Enables both **local monitoring/control** and **Viessmann's cloud services** in parallel.
- Data accessible via **MQTT** or TCP/IP for smart home integration (e.g. Home Assistant).
- Supports **VS2 and VS1/KW protocols** with different branches.  
  - The [vs1test branch](https://github.com/philippoo66/optolink-splitter/tree/vs1test) enables **VS1/KW protocol support** but works **only without** Vitoconnect.  
  - For **VS1/KW with Vitoconnect**, the [viconn-listener](https://github.com/philippoo66/viconn-listener) is available (currently in beta).

## :file_folder: Software Requirements
- Python (version >= 3.9):
  - pyserial: `pip install pyserial`
  - MQTT (version >= 2.0): `pip install paho-mqtt` 
- Virtual environments recommended ([Guide](https://github.com/philippoo66/optolink-splitter/wiki/510-error:-externally%E2%80%90managed%E2%80%90environment-%E2%80%90%E2%80%90-venv)).

## :desktop_computer:	Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi or a suitable system.
- Viessmann Optolink-compatible heating (Vitodens, Vitocal, Vitocrossal, etc.).
- Optolink r/w head:
  - Original Viessmann model or self-made.
  - Volksz√§hler-compatible versions may work if LED distance is adjusted ([8‚Ç¨ option](https://www.ebay.de/itm/285350331996)).
- To retain **ViCare App functionality**, use a USB-to-TTL adapter:
  - Recommended: CP2102 chip ([Example](https://www.google.com/search?q=cp2102+usb+ttl)).
  - Some newer Vitoconnect models may work with FTDI chips.
  - **Raspberry Pi UART voltage = 3.3V** ‚Üí Set jumper accordingly!

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation
For detailed information on Installation & Configuration, please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/EarlSneedSinclair/optolink-splitter/wiki).

## :house: Smart Home Integration (e.g. Home Assistant)
Optolink Splitter seamlessly integrates into your smart home setup via **MQTT**, allowing you to monitor and control your Viessmann heating system using platforms like **Home Assistant**, **ioBroker**, or **Node-RED**. All available heating system data can be visualized in dashboards, automated with custom rules, and integrated into broader smart home routines. With Optolink Splitter‚Äôs command-sending capability, you can locally adjust heating modes, temperature setpoints, or pump states directly from your favorite smart home system.

For detailed **Home Assistant integration instructions**, see the [Wiki | Home Assistant Integration of Optolink‚ÄêSplitter](https://github.com/philippoo66/optolink-splitter/wiki/210-Home-Assistant-Integration-of-Optolink%E2%80%90Splitter).  

Below are examples of how this integration looks in different smart home environments:
